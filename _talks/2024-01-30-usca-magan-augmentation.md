This talk focused on data augmentation as a critical strategy for addressing the scarcity of training data in machine learning. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating realistic and diverse synthetic datasets.

We introduced a novel two-player game approach to GAN training, which iteratively refines the generator to produce increasingly authentic samples. Additionally, we presented **MAGAN** — a *Meta-Analysis method for GANs’ latent space* — designed to analyze how variations in the latent space influence the quality and diversity of generated outputs.

Quantitative evaluations demonstrated MAGAN’s effectiveness in tracing latent space transformations, highlighting the potential of GANs as parameterized data generators. This methodology supports more robust data-driven augmentation techniques, offering a compelling solution to the challenge of limited labeled datasets during model development.
