This talk covered two key developments in the areas of hardware security and machine learning.

The first part focused on security for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. I introduced CERRO PUF — a Cost-Efficient Reliable Reconfigurable Ring Oscillator Physical Unclonable Function — designed to enhance hardware-level security. CERRO PUF reduces power consumption and design overhead while maintaining strong security. The presentation included performance insights and comparisons with existing methods, highlighting its resilience against machine learning-based attacks.

In the second half, I shifted to data augmentation in machine learning, particularly using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). I presented a training strategy based on a two-player game framework, along with MAGAN, a Meta-Analysis method for GANs’ latent space. MAGAN helps explain how changes in the latent space influence the quality and diversity of generated outputs. Together, these contributions aim to make data generation more reliable in cases where labeled data is limited.
