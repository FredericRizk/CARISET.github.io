This research talk delves into two significant advancements in hardware security and machine learning.

We first explore hardware-level security for Internet of Things (IoT) devices through a novel **Cost-Efficient Reliable Reconfigurable Ring Oscillator Physical Unclonable Function (CERRO PUF)**. CERRO PUF presents a promising solution that significantly reduces design overhead and power consumption while maintaining high efficiency and security. The talk includes a detailed analysis of CERRO PUF's performance, showcasing its improved challenge-response pair generation and resistance to machine learning-based attacks compared to existing designs.

The second part of the talk addresses data augmentation — a crucial strategy for overcoming limited training data in machine learning. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are highlighted as powerful tools for synthesizing diverse and realistic data. We introduce a two-player game approach for GAN training and present **MAGAN**, a *Meta-Analysis method for GANs’ latent space*. MAGAN reveals the relationship between latent space and generated outputs and demonstrates high accuracy in tracing transformations. These insights affirm the potential of GANs as effective, parameterized data generators for enhancing data-driven augmentation pipelines.
