This talk introduced **KAN-MID**, a novel AI-based cybersecurity framework that leverages **Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold Networks (KANs)** for detecting **malicious URLs** and **intrusion attempts**.

Cybersecurity threats such as malicious URLs and unauthorized intrusions continue to cause data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage. Most existing systems rely on signature-based detection, which often fails to identify emerging or previously unseen threats. Traditional methods are increasingly inadequate due to the growing sophistication of attacks.

**KAN-MID** addresses this challenge by applying modern AI/ML models to deliver more robust and adaptive detection. The framework enhances detection accuracy and resilience, making it a promising direction for next-generation cybersecurity systems.

As organizations seek advanced AI-driven approaches to bolster defenses, KAN-MID exemplifies the integration of machine learning into critical infrastructure protection.
