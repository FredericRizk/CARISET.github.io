This talk focused on data augmentation — a crucial strategy for overcoming the scarcity of training data in machine learning. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as powerful tools for producing realistic and diverse synthetic datasets.

We introduced a novel two-player game approach to GAN training that iteratively refines the generator to synthesize increasingly authentic samples. We also presented **MAGAN** — a *Meta-Analysis method for GANs’ latent space* — which reveals how changes in latent variables influence generated outputs.

Quantitative evaluations from MAGAN demonstrated its accuracy in tracing latent space transformations, affirming the potential of GANs as parameterized data generators. This approach enhances data-driven augmentation and addresses the challenge of limited labeled datasets during model training.
